Tails
=====

Port of Tails with the same capabilities. Since the Appendages project got a bit scope-creeped... lmao.

### quick notes

* Client only mod, with server component just for syncing.
  * It might be possible to split "client-to-client-syncing" into a reusable library
    * but for now just keep everything inside the mod
* more of a focus on getting things to work, less on extensibility
  * ship a minimum viable product
